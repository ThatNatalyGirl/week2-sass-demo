SASS

Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets

We're taking SASS and turning it into CSS files and spitting it out on the websites

variables
	- set it to a $name: then call that

	$ is needed!!!!!

	$ = variable

***************************************


fun things to do with variables!
-MATH

/* this */
.parent {

  .child {
    background: red;
  }
}

/* is the same as this */
.parent .child {
  background: red;
}

There's a thing called media image
Like a social media content or a profile picture with some text behind it.
I have a little thing on the left and a bunch of stuff to the left of it. Generically we call it a media clas


COMPLEX NESTING
& means 'and also'

> means 'direct child'

/* Applies to parent that also has red class */
.parent {
	
  &.red {
    background: red;
  }
}
	
	
/* Apply to all direct children */
.someclass {
  >* {
    max-width: 640px;
    margin: 10px auto;
  }	
}
	

@-RULES
Also known as Directives.

So named because they are prefixed with an @ symbol

SASS has some additional things that have special functions
	@extend
	@mixin
	@media
	@include	
***@extend, import, and mixin works better for bigger sized projects

@media - We know this

@import - merge partial files into your main one
	underscored files to be able to be called

so you can write other sass files then call them in the original file


@extend lets you duplicate class names and use it somewhere else.
you can use the %name and then call @extend %name;

@mixin, @include
	Code you define once, reuse anywhere
	-Define code with @mixin
	-use code with @include

Breakpoint
@mixin bp-large {
  @media only screen and (min-width: $desktop-breakpoint) {
    @content; // This lets you put stuff inside of the mixin
  }
}

@mixin bp-small {
  @media only screen and (min-width: $tablet-breakpoint) {
    @content;
  }
}
